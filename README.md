# Introductory-Options-24
As part of my exploration into derivatives, I developed a strong and practical understanding of fundamental option theory, including the mechanics of call and put options, concepts like moneyness, and various payoff structures. I studied and compared several core option strategies such as straddles and strangles, analyzing how these strategies respond under different market conditions and applying them to real-world trading scenarios. A significant part of this learning involved understanding the Option Greeks—delta, gamma, vega, and rho—and how each Greek contributes to pricing, risk exposure, and decision-making in dynamic market environments. To strengthen my conceptual clarity and gain hands-on experience, I also integrated Python-based tools to model option payoffs and visualize the sensitivity of options to changing market variables, which helped me better interpret and quantify the implications of volatility, time decay, and other influencing factors on an options portfolio
